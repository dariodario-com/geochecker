/**
 * Map a check's score to its status.
 *
 * `hasFindings` says whether the check actually NAMED a problem — the same
 * branch that produced its `finding` string. It matters because status used to
 * be derived from the score alone, and a check can score well while still
 * reporting real gaps: a page with one H1 rule broken out of several scored 80
 * and was labelled `pass`, so a UI rendered a green tick next to the sentence
 * "Heading structure has gaps". Green-plus-a-complaint is a contradiction, and
 * readers resolve it by trusting neither.
 *
 * So a check that named a problem cannot be `pass`; the worst it becomes is
 * `warn`. Scores are untouched — `overall` and every category score are
 * unchanged by this — because the score measures MAGNITUDE and the status
 * answers "is there something here to do?". Those are different questions and
 * conflating them is what produced the contradiction.
