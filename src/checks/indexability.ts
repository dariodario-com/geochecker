 * Indexability — can a search engine list this page at all?
 *
 * These sit apart from `crawlability`, which asks whether AI search crawlers are
 * *allowed in* by robots.txt. Indexability is the next question: once a crawler
 * has the page, is it permitted and able to index it, and is the site telling
 * engines which URL is canonical.
 *
 * Measured on 172 real prospects before these were written, so the hit rates are
 * known rather than guessed: 26% have no canonical tag, 15% have no sitemap, and
 * 3% are actively serving `noindex` — that last group is invisible in Google
 * today and almost always does not know it.
 *
 * All three are answerable from the page already fetched plus at most one extra
 * request, and each has a concrete, ordinary fix.
