/**
 * AI crawlers grouped by PURPOSE. This distinction is the whole point of the
 * 2026 robots.txt model (IETF AIPREF `train-ai` vs `search`; Cloudflare's
 * purpose-based defaults): being cited by AI search depends on letting the
 * SEARCH and LIVE-fetch crawlers through. Blocking TRAINING-only crawlers is a
 * legitimate IP/privacy choice that does NOT reduce citation — so we never
 * penalise it.
 *
 * `Google-Extended` / `Applebot-Extended` are intentionally omitted: they are
 * robots.txt control tokens, not crawlers. They govern downstream training use
 * of content already fetched by Googlebot/Applebot, and blocking them has no
 * effect on search or citation.
