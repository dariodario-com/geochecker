 * llms.txt is INFORMATIONAL ONLY — weight 0, never affects the score.
 *
 * As of mid-2026 the evidence is that no major AI search engine consumes
 * llms.txt for retrieval or citation: Ahrefs found ~97% of llms.txt files
 * received zero bot requests (137K domains, Jun 2026) and Google (Mueller,
 * Illyes) states no AI system uses it. Its only confirmed real use is routing
 * for developer coding agents (Cursor, Mintlify, docs tooling). We still report
 * its presence as a neutral note, but we no longer treat its absence as a
 * problem — docking points for a missing file that AI search ignores would be
 * misleading.
